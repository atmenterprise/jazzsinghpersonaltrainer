                with not just weight loss, increased strength, body toning and correcting
                posture, but health conditions such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure,
                high cholesterol, and hemiplegia.

                    Nutrition plan adjustments because these will be essential as your progress will slow down the more

                <li class="list-padding">
