            <p>
                <strong>Informed consent:</strong> The programme will be based upon your present activity/exercise
                levels
                and the goals
                that you wish to achieve. You will experience some feelings of exertion during each activity session
                and will become hot and uncomfortable at times, if your plan includes certain types of cardiovascular
                exercise. Your breathing and heart rate will increase as a result of these activities as would be
                expected from physical exercise of this type. As your fitness improves, you will participate in more
                vigorous levels of activity if this is part of your goal, but these will be within your capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Activities will be explained and/or demonstrated either in person, video or with an exercise guide
                (depending on service that has been opted for) but please feel free to ask questions about anything
                you wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                If, at any time, you feel undue pain or excessive discomfort stop the activity and inform your trainer
                of your symptoms. You are free to withdraw from any activity at any time you wish.
            </p>

                <strong>Assumption Of Risk:</strong> Any exercise programme carries with it an element of risk. The
                sessions will be designed to minimise the risks whilst providing an effective exercise/activity
                intensity.
                Please inform the instructor if, for any reason (such as illness or injury which might be aggravated by
                exercise, or eating certain foods), you should not participate in an activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that you are voluntarily participating in any physical exercise or activity, including
                personal training, or using any facility or equipment, you do so at your own risk and assume the risk
                of any and all injury and/or damage you may suffer, whether while engaging in physical exercise or not.

                executors,
                administrators, agents, and assigns) to release and discharge Trainer (and Trainer’s affiliates,
                related entities, employees, agents, representatives, successors, and assigns) from any and all
                claims or causes of action (known or unknown) arising out of the negligence of Trainer, whether
                active or passive, or any of Trainer’s affiliates, employees, agents, representatives, successors,
                and assigns.

                <strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> You are aware and agree that by executing this waiver and release,
                you are giving
                up your right to bring a legal action or assert a claim against trainer for trainer’s negligence, or
                for any defective product used while receiving personal training from trainer. You have read and

            <p>
                If you have answered 'YES' to one or more questions on the Medical Health Form:
                Talk to your doctor by phone or in person before you start becoming more physically active and before
                you have a fitness assessment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tell your doctor about the questionnaire and which question(s) you have answered yes to. You may be
                able to do any activity you want - as long as you begin slowly and build up gradually, or you may
                need to restrict your activities to those which are safe for you. Talk with your doctor about the kind
                of activity you wish to participate in and follow his/her advice.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have answered 'NO' to all questions on the Medical Health Form:
                You can be reasonably sure that you an start to become more physically active and take part in
                a suitable exercise program. Remember - begin slowly and build up gradually.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Please note:</strong> If your health changes so that subsequently you answer 'YES' to any of the above questions,
                inform your fitness or health professional immediately. Ask whether you should change your physical
                activity or exercise plan. Delay becoming more active if you feel unwell because of a temporary
                illness such as flu, fever, etc. - wait until you are better.
