                    Hi, Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Jaz</span> a Nutritionist/PT with over

                    Since 2004 I have been living with a rare auto-immune condition, which resulted in me being
                    wheelchair bound, requiring multiple surgeries, and told I may not have kids. Now, I am married, a
                    father of 3 and walking again. I took my health into my own hands to win the battle and now just do
                    my best to manage my unpredictable rare auto-immune condition, along with epilepsy with positive
                    lifestyle changes.

                <h4 class="lead text-justify">
                    The above brought me to work in the industry to inspire,

                    their symptoms. This allowed them to use their new lifestyle habits to live a
