                    Hi, Iâ€™m <span class="highlight">Jaz</span> a Nutritionist and Personal Trainer (PT) with over 10 years
                    of experience in the health & fitness industry.

                <h4 class="lead text-justify">
                    Since 2004 I have been living with a rare auto-immune condition, which
                    resulted in me being wheelchair bound, requiring multiple surgeries, and told I
                    may not have kids. Now, I am married, a father of 3 and walking again. I took
                    my health into my own hands to win the battle and now just do my best to
                    manage my unpredictable rare auto-immune condition, along with epilepsy
                    with positive lifestyle changes.
                </h4>
                <h4 class="lead text-justify">
                    The above brought me to work in the industry to inspire, motivate
                    <i>(while showing empathy)</i> to get the best results for my clients. All have
                    lost weight, become healthier, fitter, stronger &amp; more confident.

                <h4 class="lead text-justify">
                    Over the course of myself being a nutritionist and personal trainer I have trained and helped
                    many people with not just <span class="highlight">weight loss</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">increased strength</span>,
                    <span class="highlight">body toning</span> and
                    <span class="highlight">correcting posture</span>, but health conditions such as
                        <span class="highlight">high blood sugar</span>,

                                <span class="highlight">high cholesterol</span>, and

                    I also volunteered as an <span class="highlight">Expert Patient Programme Tutor</span> in the past,
                    teaching others living with long-term health conditions, how to manage their health by
                    managing their symptoms. This allowed them to use their new lifestyle habits
                    to live a healthier &amp; more independent life.
